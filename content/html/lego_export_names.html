    <p>Going back to our lego example:
    You will give your friend a complete lego car. He shouldn't care about how you have built this car and which stones you have used.
    You won't share your way of building the car.
    Perhaps you have built the your car with one special trick which makes your car better than his.
        In this case, you only want to give him the possibility to get a car and not more functionality.</p>
