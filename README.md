# A Tour of Go is an introduction to the Go programming language.

This tour is adapted for a hands-on workshop at a Women Techmakers Rhein-Main meetup in August 2018.
I mostly changed the beginning by adding additional explanations and integrating art work.

The easiest way to install the tour locally is to install
[a binary release of Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and then run:

	$ go tool tour

To install the tour from source, first 
[set up a workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) and then run:

	$ go get github.com/akwick/go-tutorial/gotour

This will place a `gotour` binary in your workspace's `bin` directory.

This tour is a changed version of the original and awesome [go tour](https://github.com/golang/tour).
