    <b class="headline"> Packages and Main Function:</b>
  <p>  Let's start with the basics:
Every Go program is made up of packages.
You can imagine a package as a lego package, e.g., a package with a farm.
In the end, you will use this farm package and probably use some other legos to built something bigger.
You can imagine this bigger solution as your program.
For a complex lego farm you will need different lego pieces and packets, e.g., a car and a lake next to your farm.
      One can compare these pieces with a package: A package provides you some functionality.</p>

<p>If you often creating a lego farm, you perhaps have reused components from another farm isn't?
You can do the same with Go.
    If you use a package, you reuse a component written either by yourself or others to achieve your aim.</p>

<p>As a computer, needs to know exactly what he has to do you need to provide him the information about the packages you are planning to use.
You can do this by importing the corresponding package, e.g. `"fmt"`.
The package `"fmt"` offers functionalities to print content to the command line.
    If you want to use a functionality aka a function of the package, you need to mark it by writting `fmt.FUNCTIONNAME`.</p>

<p>Besides describing precisely which functionality a computer should use, you need to tell the computer which function he should execute.
We call this the main function which is in the package `main`.
    You define the package name in the first line of the program by writing `package PACKAGENAME`. </p> </div>
